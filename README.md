# ZendeskTicketViewer
Takes the data from Zendesk's Ticket API and formats into clean and easy to read output for the user




## Installation

1. Needs a third party JSON file parser, I used this one from Google [here](https://github.com/google/gson).
2. Create a txt file that has the URL on one line and the username:password on the next
3. Save that in a location and state the path  to it in ZenRequest.java file in the variable ZENDESK_RESOURCE_FILE


## Features

- View 25 tickets at a time
- View single tickets based off the ID
- Easy to read data



## Appendix
I used Intellij, it can be downloaded [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) but not sure how this will compile on other IDE such as Eclipse.
